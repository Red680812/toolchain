=================================
Toolchain 4.4.3 - 4.6 - 4.7 - 4.8
=================================

Run one of the following commands from the kernel directory for the toolchain branch you need.
This will create a folder named (toolchain) and pull all files to it...

git clone https://github.com/GameTheory-/toolchain.git -b 4.4.3 toolchain

git clone https://github.com/GameTheory-/toolchain.git -b 4.6 toolchain

git clone https://github.com/GameTheory-/toolchain.git -b 4.7 toolchain

git clone https://github.com/GameTheory-/toolchain.git -b 4.8 toolchain

This will be your export path...

export CROSS_COMPILE=toolchain/arm-eabi-4.X.X/bin/arm-eabi-

Make sure to edit version in export path where X is accordingly.
